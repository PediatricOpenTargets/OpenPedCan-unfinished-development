## In development code for copy number variant (CNV) API evidence plots
*Author:* Kelsey Keith @kelseykeith

### Purpose

This section documents and has executable code for the in development copy number variant (CNV) evidence view plots for the OpenPedCan/MTP API.
This is an intermediate step in the development of an `OpenPedCan-api` plot (see general development outline in the main repository README). 
The database for this plot was tentatively completed and a PR was submitted for review, but it was not incorporated into the codebase before the project ended.
If you would like to see the database code that would go along with this plot, please see the [development fork](https://github.com/kelseykeith/OpenPedCan-api/tree/cnv-db).

This code cannot be used with the API as is and is included for archival purposes only; if you would like to start working on API development, please see the [main repository README](https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-unfinished-development) 
**WARNING:** This code is not maintained and there may be breaking changes at any time. 
Also, funding has ended for this portion of the MTP project so data may no longer be available in the same way. 
For the most up-to-date instructions on how to access code and data, please see the main [OpenPedCan-analysis repository](https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis).
